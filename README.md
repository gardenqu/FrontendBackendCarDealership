This is my Car Dealership Application

Frontend is Angular
Backend is Spring Boot JPA

Currently it has full CRUD functionality. 
I am working on implementing a Login/Logout Componenet along with User session data. 
Goals: Host it somewhere

I am using Java Spring Boot JPA for developing the backend. 
I also like how it connects with postgreSql (by far my favorite database). This project is a recreation of the "Riddlers Rides" project which was my final group capstone project. 
I felt I had not really done much so in order to rectify that I am creating another Car Dealership web applications. This one will have full CRUD capabilties, have a login feature, and also have User roles. This project is a work in progress.
